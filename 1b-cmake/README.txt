It will be a story how I and my exgirlfriend Kristina met. It was a 2020 summer, I just have relax in my tongue town after study-filled year, because I was tired: we with my friends keeped days as funny as we can - big walks, often sleepovers with all related point and approaching to the nature. I talk about it to bring it to theme.
In one beautiful day my friend Grigoriy sends me a message in Telegram: "Do you want to keep some time with me and my know girls?". Due to my big boredom I agreed. As a result we met after all, but I absolutely didn't have any thoughts, what I can and what I can't say in this company since I just was 15 years old. For this reason I didn't control my behavior(to be honest, in those days I was so nasty, that my friends sometimes in joke told me that I should to change something in my worldview). But despite all this she noticed something in me (I don't know what precisely still), but I I didn 't pay much attention or importance to she, as was too young(I think so). Next, in those "joking" times I betted on something with my friends and lost... Their goal was for me to go out for a walk with any girl, because of my confrontation on this theme worldview. 
Then we began to communicate more closely. But that's a completely different story.
